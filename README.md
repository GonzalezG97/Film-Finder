# Film-Finder

## Description 

As an avid movie watcher, I wanted to create an application that will find new movies for me based on genre.

## Table of Contents


* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [Questions](#questions)


## Usage
This application shows a list of movies based on selected genres:  horror, comedy, romance, action, and animated. Once the genre is selected a list of movies fitting that genre will render. Will then be able to save movies to a “Watch List”, to keep track of them.
