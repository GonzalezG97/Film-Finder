# project1-film-finder

User Story: As a film buff, I want to create an application that will find movies for me based on genre, so that I can know if the movie is worth the watch.


Project Description: Our application shows a list of movies based on selected genres:  horror, comedy, romance, action, and animated. Once the user selects a genre they are  given a list of movies fitting that genre specification. The user will then be able to save movies to a “watch list”.
